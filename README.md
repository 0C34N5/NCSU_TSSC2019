# IMPROVING ATSPM’S APPROACH DELAY CALCULATION
North Carolina State University's Team Repository for the TSSC 2019 Big Data Challenge

Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) is a recent development which provides performance measures that can be used for decision making and selection of more effective operational strategies that could reduce the total delay and cost. However, the delay estimation method of ATSPM is extremely simplified and ignores some of the fundamental components of delay experienced by motorists at a traffic signal. The team proposes three alternative methodologies for estimation of approach delay, each of which addresses one or more of the drawbacks currently present in the ATSPM framework. The cumulative arrival/departure method uses upstream and downstream detection and incorporates the stop, deceleration, and the acceleration delays into the approach delay. Departure-only method uses the actuations at the departure detectors to estimate the approach delay that are comprised of the stop and initial queue delays. The shockwave method uses arrival and departure detections to estimate the approach delay.  Stop component of the approach delay is fully incorporated in the estimates by this method. Results of the proposed methodologies reveal promising improvements over ATSPM’s conventional delay framework.
